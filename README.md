# Cipher Methods
## Ceasar
The Caesar shift relies on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic order.
## Polybius
The Polybius square cipher is achieved by arranging a typical alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. For example, in the table below, the letter B would be represented by the numerical pair 21.

## Substitution
The substitution cipher requires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the substitution alphabet. This cipher requires that the recipient have the substitution alphabet, otherwise it will be difficult for them to decode the message.
